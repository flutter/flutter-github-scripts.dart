This repository contains scripts written in Dart to report on various
aspects of code health within the
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) [repository](https://github.com/flutter).

They're probably not terribly useful if you're not a Flutter
contributor, but you might find some snippets here that
show you how to access Github using either GraphQL or the
REST API.

## Setup

You must have an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` set with a valid GitHub token
for any of these scripts to work.

## Scripts
This repository has the following scripts.

### run_release_report.sh

Usage: `run_release_report.sh [to-date]`
Runs a release report from Flutter's 1.20 stable release through the given date.

Creates the files notable-contributors, prs_merged_by_label, prs_merged, 
issues_closed in Markdown, DOCX, and HTML.

#### Detailed Instructions

##### Dependencies
You'll need to have `pandoc` installed. See [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for an installer. The `run-release-report.sh` script uses `pandoc` under the hood to convert the generated Markdown to other formats. If you don't have it installed, the script will fail, but you'll have markdown files that you can inspect with a program like `emacs` or `vim`.

Under the hood, these scripts ralso ely on the following Dart programs in this repository:

*   `bin/notable_contributors.dart`
*   `bin/clusters.dart`
*   `bin/prs.dart`
*   `bin/issues.dart`

You can also run any of these Dart applications standalone; instructions are below, 
or run a script with the `--help` argument.
##### Process to get the release report

1. For `run-release-reports.sh` to work, you need to have access to a list of organization members. This list is only available to Googlers because it contains PII; for information as to how to create this list, see [go/flutter-release-notes-tooling](https://goto2.corp.google.com/flutter-release-notes-tooling), available on the Google intranet. You'll follow the instructions there, and create a file called `go_flutter_org_members.csv`. *This file should not be committed to Github, as it has PII.*
2. Obtain the commit dates you want which span the release of interest. Typically this is the date for the last tag of interest to the current tag of interest, written in ISO-8601 format (e.g., `2021-05-14T07:22:00-0700`). For example, Flutter 2.2 was tagged on `2021-05-14T07:22:00-0700`; the latest release of Flutter 2.3 (Flutter 2.3.0-24.1.pre was tagged on `2101-06-25T09:24:00-0700`. You can find this information at https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases. To get a date for something that says something like “7 days ago”, hover over the date and wait about 5 seconds; Github will show the precise date and time of the tag.
3. Run `run-release-reports.sh` in the `flutter-github-scripts.dart` directory. You will need to use the dates you obtained in (3). _By default, the script runs from Flutter 2.2 through the current date and time_. To change this, you can edit the script and update lines 2 & 4. For sanity’s sake, _keep the comment and the date in sync_. For example, to run the report from Flutter 2.2 through Flutter 2.3 beta, use the command
`./run-release-reports.sh 2021-06-25T09:24:00-0700`
5. Go get a cup of coffee. It takes a while. The script will print status messages along the way. For a three-month release window, expect it to take ~45 minutes.

##### Files Generated

The script generates the following files:
*   `all-contributors-committers.[docx|html|md]` - All committers within the date range you specify. Data includes the counts of commits from each contributor as well as the individual commits.
*   `all-contributors-reviewers.[docx|html|md]` - All reviewers within the date range you specify. Data includes the counts of commits from each contributor as well as the individual commits.
*   `notable-contributors-committers.[docx|html|md]` - All unpaid committers within the date range you specify. Data includes the counts of commits from each contributor as well as the individual commits. _For this to be accurate, `go_flutter_org_members.csv` must be up to date. See (2), above._
*   `notable-contributors-reviewers.[docx|html|md]` - All unpaid reviewers within the date range you specify. Data includes the counts of reviews from each contributor as well as the individual reviews. _For this to be accurate, `go_flutter_org_members.csv` must be up to date. See (2), above._
*   `prs_merged_by_label.[docx|html|md]` - Pull requests committed in the date range, clustered by label, from largest to smallest by label.
*   `prs_merged.[docx|html|md]` - All pull requests merged in the date range, sorted by pull request number.
*   `issues_closed.[docx|html|md]` All issues closed in the date range, sorted by the issue number.

If you're doing this as part of a real release, you should save these results. Googlers can save these files For housekeeping; these should be copied to a new release directory on [Flutter’s shared drive](https://drive.google.com/corp/drive/u/0/folders/1Z6ppzZPsyfXJD1Zf6jd-2pUGRh66D9QU?resourcekey=0-x48WXccrJ3cKDRyT0P1b7Q). This link is only available to Googlers.

The script generates output in DOCX, Markdown and HTML formats. You can immediately import the `.docx` files into Google Drive for easy viewing, copying, and pasting with formatting. 

Some files, notably `prs_merged_by_label` and `prs_merged`, may require light editing to get them in the format required for the PR to the web site. See an existing release notes doc, like `website/src/docs/development/tools/sdk/release-notes/release-notes-2.2.0.md` for an example.

##### Notes

As of Dart 2.14, there’s an issue with a dependency of a dependency (the package `uuid`) that has yet to be properly migrated. KF6GPE hasn’t had time to fix this, and has instead chosen to pin the Dart version in `pubspec.yaml` to Dart 2.13.4. This is the version of Dart shipping with Flutter 2.2, so for the next stable release, you should be able to use that version of Dart. This and the dependency scripts may not work for you after that unless you pin the Dart version.

The scripts occasionally time out when Github is being cranky, and you’ll see errors. Don’t panic; just go for a walk and re-run the script.
